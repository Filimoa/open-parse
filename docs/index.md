# Welcome to Open Parse

**Easily chunk complex documents the same way a human would.**  

Chunking documents is a challenging task that underpins any RAG system.  High quality results are critical to a sucessful AI application, yet most open-source libraries are limited in their ability to handle complex documents.  

Open Parse is designed to fill this gap by providing a flexible, easy-to-use library capable of visually discerning document layouts and chunking them effectively.

## Features

- 🔍 Visually-Driven: Open-Parse visually analyzes documents for superior LLM input, going beyond naive text splitting.
- ✍️ Markdown Support: Basic markdown support for parsing headings, bold and italics.
- 📊 High-Precision Table Support: Extract tables into clean Markdown formats with accuracy that surpasses traditional tools.
- 🛠️ Extensible: Easily implement your own post-processing steps.
- 💡Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.

## Quick Start

## Basic Example

```python
import openparse

basic_doc_path = "./sample-docs/mobile-home-manual.pdf"
parser = openparse.DocumentParser()
parsed_basic_doc = parser.parse(basic_doc_path)

for node in parsed_basic_doc.nodes:
    print(node)
```

## Semantic Processing Example

Chunking documents is fundamentally about grouping similar semantic nodes together. By embedding the text of each node, we can then cluster them together based on their similarity.

```python
from openparse import processing, DocumentParser

semantic_pipeline = processing.SemanticIngestionPipeline(
    openai_api_key=OPEN_AI_KEY,
    model="text-embedding-3-large",
    min_tokens=64,
    max_tokens=1024,
)
parser = DocumentParser(
    processing_pipeline=semantic_pipeline,
)
parsed_content = parser.parse(basic_doc_path)
```
